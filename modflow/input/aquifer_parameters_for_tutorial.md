## 1. Specific storage
(1) definition: the volume of water released from storage per unit decline in hydraulic head in the aquifer, per unit area of the aquifer.
The equation is as follow:

$$
\mathbf{S} = \frac{dV_{w}}{dh} \cdot \frac{1}{A}
$$

That is to say, when the aquifer experiences the same change in water volume, a smaller S will reault in a larger change in hydraulic head.
